# SchoolListIt

### Covid-19 has put education at all levels into a tailspin
Many schools are not going back in a normal fashion this fall, many are using a blended remote/in person model, and some still have not finalized thier plans. Fully in-person attendance may not be sustainable if areas with continued outbreak. This creates a particularly tough challenge for many families including 
- lower income students with no internet
- students in rural areas with poor internet access (many of these also have no mobile coverage)
- dual income families
- single parent families

Parents need a solution that helps them keep thier students on track. 
Teachers need streamlined communications with families.
Students need help from thier parents, grandparents, extended family, and friends.

## SchoolListIt Makes That Possible no matter how you school

It takes a village
Even in a normal school setting, we cannot reduce the education gap without understanding a student’s extended family. In particular, single parent homes rely on a larger circle for help. However, only legal guardians have access to most student information systems. Our parents, friends, and neighbors cannot help if they cannot access what is due for schoolwork and when it is due.
Instead of complaining, I went to work. SchoolListit is the result.

I am a working mom who built this solution out of necessity. I have two school aged children and a job and a baby - and now I have no daycare and no school for my children. I can’t hire a nanny or an in-home tutor willing to work in someone else’s home. The risk of contracting Covid-19 is too high. This is not only my reality. I share this reality with much of America.

Even in normal school life, for most parents, getting enough detail to genuinely help with school means taking off work. 

SchoolListIt solves this problem.

Through SchoolListIt, we can push the boundaries of in-home schooling regardless of Covid-19 and emerge as a society with better tools and better data to provide an equal education regardless of the circumstances children are living. 


SchoolListIt is a platform for integrating modular open source solutions for Education during and post Covid-19.
