# SchoolListIt

### Covid-19 has put education at all levels into a tailspin
Many schools are not going back in a normal fashion this fall, many are using a blended remote/in person model, and some still have not finalized thier plans. Fully in-person attendance may not be sustainable if areas with continued outbreak. Many families are uncomfortable sending thier children into such uncertainty, and are opting out of public school and into homeschooling. 

This creates a particularly tough challenge for many families including 
- students with fewer choices
- lower income students with poor internet access 
- students in rural areas with poor internet access (many with little or no mobile coverage)
- dual income families
- single parent families

Parents need a solution that helps them oversee and monitor thier students' performance.

Teachers need streamlined communications with families.

Students need help staying on track from a wider sphere of support.

## SchoolListIt: what is due and when for any school, anywhere no matter how you school

**It takes a village**

Even in a normal school setting, we cannot ensure fair and equal education without including a student’s extended family and better understanding the challenges at home. In particular, single parent homes rely on a larger circle for help. However, only legal guardians have access to most student information systems. Our parents, friends, and neighbors cannot help if they cannot access what is due for schoolwork and when it is due.

### Instead of complaining, I went to work. SchoolListit is the result.

I am a working mom who built this solution out of necessity. I have two school aged children and a job and a baby - and now I have no daycare and no school for my children. I can’t hire a nanny or an in-home tutor willing to work in someone else’s home for fear of contracting or spreading Covid-19. This is not only my reality. I share this reality with much of America. 

Even in normal school life, for most parents, getting enough detail to genuinely help with school means taking off work. When the choice lies between paying the rent and helping with schoolwork, the rent wins every time. 

Teachers rely on so many great learning apps, but for a mom with multiple children that is compounded exponentially. Each child has multiple teachers with multiple apps and different systems. It quickly becomes turns into chaos. When remote learning began after Covid, I scoured the web for an app that could organize the chaos, but **there just isn't an app for that.**

**SchoolListIt solves this problem.**

SchoolListIt is all about including more people.  Now, more than ever - It really does take a village. 

SchoolListit is a free and open platform for parents, teachers, and anyone in a student’s support sphere - schools, teachers, classes can be created on the fly - nothing is private by design. *Think of SchoolListit as the bulletin board in the town square, where anyone can post and everyone can benefit.*

Instead of reinventing what teachers and schools are likely to use, I chose to build a react app that can feed from any existing system's data via REST API. 

The possibilities are endless when you approach a problem from an entirely new angle. I built SchoolListIt considering education from outside the classroom and outside the boardroom School-list-it pairs react with WordPress. Because even though we may not know exactly what we need today, **I’d bet there’s a plugin for that**. 

Working parents have always struggled to help with schoolwork, but School-list-it can give them a glimpse into the classroom they’ve just never had before. 

**Who knows, maybe Covid-19 can bring in an era of equal education.**


SchoolListIt can facilitate equal education from outside the classroom during Covid-19 and after
because SchoolListit assumes the most challenging circumstances and degrades gracefully providing a consistent and understandable user experience that doesn’t have to change even with shifting circumstances.

In the worst connectivity scenario, our app can work offline and sync when connection is restored. We built the user experience for phones with an interface that mimics social media so that parents of all ages and aptitude can participate. 

Through SchoolListIt, we can push the effectiveness of in-home schooling regardless of Covid-19 and emerge as a society with better tools and better data to provide an equal education regardless of the circumstances children are living. 

**A fresh approach**

We approached this problem from an entirely new angle - outside the classroom and outside the boardroom - and began with only three constraints:
- Open Source
- Accesible
- Extensible

By chooseing to pair React with WordPress, we've set up a toolchain for integrating existing tools and making room for new solutions. During a global pandemic, it is ideal for local developers to build local solutions for local problems.
